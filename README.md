# HR Data Analysis Project

## 👋 Overview
This project involves **analyzing HR data** to gain insights into employee salary distribution based on gender and age. The dataset used is a **sample HR dataset** taken from GitHub, and the analysis is performed using **Python** in **Google Colab**.

---

## 🔹 Project Objective
- Clean and preprocess HR data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and adding important features.
- Analyze **salary distribution** across different **genders** and **age groups**.
- Visualize insights to understand patterns and trends in employee salaries.

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Excel (for dataset input)

---

## 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Filled missing values
- Added important information for analysis
- Ensured data consistency and accuracy

---

## 🔹 Key Analysis
- Salary distribution by **gender**
- Salary distribution by **age**
- Visualizations include bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to identify trends

---

## 🔹 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the HR dataset (`.xlsx` file) to Colab
3. Run each cell step by step to reproduce the analysis and visualizations

---

## 🔹 Future Improvements
- Expand analysis to include **department-wise trends, performance vs salary, and attrition analysis**
- Deploy analysis as an **interactive dashboard**
- Gain real-world experience for **data analyst roles**

---

## 🔹 Insights & Takeaways
